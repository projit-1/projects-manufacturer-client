            <p>Optimizing operation performance is crucial for inventors who are aware of keeping a stoner’s experience positive to keep them on an app and engaged. According to exploration by Akamai, a alternate detention in cargo time can beget a 7 percent reduction in transformations, making it imperative for inventors to produce apps with optimized performance. In React operations, we're guaranteed a veritably fast UI by dereliction. Still, as an operation grows, inventors may encounter some performance issues. In this companion, we will bandy five important ways to optimize the performance of a React operation, includingpre-optimization ways. These include</p>
            <p>•	By keeping component state local where necessary,
                <br />
                •	By memoizing React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders,
                <br />
                •	By code-splitting in React using dynamic import(), and
                <br />
                •	By windowing or list virtualization in React
